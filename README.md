# Personal Journal Project

## Introduction

Over the course of my final year at Oberlin College, I created a digital journal that would give me data on various aspects of my life. It focused primarily on miles walked, hobbies and chores I did on a particular day, and the relationship between amount of sleep and the rating I gave for each day.

## Exploration

### Miles Walked
- I walked the most during my trip to New York, with a total of 35 miles in 10 days.
- Of the days of the week, Thursday was my highest average walk length (2.4 miles on average).

### Hobbies & Studies
- My favorite hobbies were music, tennis, and spending time with friends
- I spent more time studying statistics and psychology than engaging with my hobbies.

### Travel
- Over the course of my senior year I traveled to 6 separate states, spending 70% of my time in Ohio. 
- I had my best sleep and day ratings in Colorado, when I visited for the holidays. 

### Hours Slept & Day Ratings
- I found that my day rating was not actually tied very closely to my hours slept, with a positive correlation of about 0.21.
- I found a higher correlation between day rating and the amount of hobbies I practiced.
- I slept best on weekends, unsurprisingly.
